I'm a postgraduate student in China, and it's my personal blog. I'm interested in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Knowlege Graph, Large Language Model, NLP, Mixed Reality, etc. Also, I'm a big fan of open source, and I'm always trying to contribute to open source projects. 

I focus on Chinese politics, history and society. Although there are some unfair and unpleasant things in my life, I believe that we can make a better world together and I love my motherland very much.

Especially, I like reading, thinking and writing. Here I list some of my favorite books, music, movies, TV series and computer games. Hope you enjoy my blog.
