# Nobody Actually Cares About What You Do

> 最近在小红书上看到这篇文章，很受感触。正如文章中所强调的，“停止关注他人评价，从他人眼中解放自己”，我们没有必要因为害怕自己的每一句话、每一个动作会被别人评价而小心谨慎。为自己而活，享受生活，这才是最重要的！
>
> 原文引言：
>
> No one really cares about what we do or what we think. They have their own problems.

I always thought that everybody was watching.<br><br>
I went to a coftee shop. I order a coffee and then walk my way to my seat with my friend. I'm overreacting because everyone is watching. I fee like I'm doing something wrong or have something on my face. Most of my time at the cafe is spent almost focusing on my sitting position, how people see my face, etc.<br><br>
What are the things that I'm actually doing wrong? There's something wrong with me.<br><br>
The same story happens when I go to the gym. I'm a beginner, and I may do some exercises with bad form. I feel like I made a mistake in my workout, and I'm worried people might think I look stupid. I always thought that everybody was judging.<br><br>
At the coffee shop, I thought that I was doing something wrong. I might go to the wrong toilet. I'm afraid of someone judging me based on how I look and behave.<br><br>
<b>This might feel like a spotlight effect.</b><br><br>
The other time is when I'm working on something. I want to improve myself by going to the gym or writing every day. I am afraid sometimes that my family or my friends are going to judge me for doing that.They might judge me based on how I work out or why I spend my time writing every day. This all ends up being overthinking about what I do.<br><br>
I always thought that everybody cared about what I did.<br><br>
Whenever I do something and post it on social media, I feel like people care about it. I sometimes go to a minimarket and buy some things. I thought that people would care about it if my friends met me there. When I go on holiday and post it. I thought that people would care about where I'm going or what I do.<br><br>
Then I realized: No one really cares.<br><br>
No one even really wants to care. People have their own problems. They have their own lives. They have their own goals every day and every minute. They don't really care about what we do or what we think at the end. They might care. For 5 minutes.<br><br>
After that, they go back to doing what they do. They are focusing on the problems their families have. They might feel sad or angry. If they have all of those kinds of problems, do they have time to think about us? When we make mistakes on our own, does anyone really care for more than an hour?<br><br>
They actually don't care.<br><br>
The same way when I saw someone fall down while riding a motorcycle. It was not a big accident; he just fell down from his own bike. There are people helping him too. Disclaimer: He was alright. Then guess what? Do I think about him falling down, like why he fell down or how he fell for 24 hours? No. I started thinking about my own problems after that, I focused on my gym workout before. I focus on what I'm going to write today. I focus on myself. Just me. No other people. No other thoughts. Just me.<br><br>
We are just overreacting.<br><br>
No one really cares.<br><br>
We thought that people were watching us.<br><br>
I don't want to say that we are narcissistic, because I'm not going to talk about that. I'm just saying that it is normal to feel like that. Feeling that people might be judging us or watching us.<br><br>
It's not okay if we take action based on that.<br><br>
How people see us should not control us.<br><br>
How people judge us should not control us.<br><br>
How people perceive us should not control us.<br><br>
Except if you find it, beneficial for your change, though.<br><br>
There are times when people give me some advice, but I don't accept it. I get offensive, but I know that I was doing something wrong. This is where you need to set aside your ego and become better. Even so, those who saw and judged us controlled us without considering what was best for us.<br><br>
What can you learn?<br><br>
What you can learn is that you need to focus on yourself. Just work on yourself. Train hard. Be better. Wake up early. Sleep enough. Those are what you need to focus on. You don't have to think about how people see you or how they behave toward you. Just focus on yourself and improve yourself. At least every day for 1%.<br><br>
When I stop thinking about other people, realizing that they don't care,I become more focused.became more controlled. I have the freedom to do what I want to do. The same as you. You have the freedom if you mistakenly park in the wrong parking spot. You have freedom if you mistakenly order the wrong menu. You have freedom if you mistakenly say the wrong things. At least you learn from those mistakes.<br><br>
You become better. You evaluate yourself.<br><br>
Those are much more important than what other people see or judge.<br><br>
Focus on yourself.<br><br>
lmprove yourself.<br><br>
Have tunnel vision.

我总觉得所有人都在看我。<br><br>
我去咖啡馆点了一杯咖啡，和朋友一起走到座位时，我的反应过度了，因为我觉得大家都在看我。我感觉自己是不是做错了什么，或者脸上有什么东西。在咖啡馆的大部分时间，我都在纠结自己的坐姿，想着别人怎么看我的脸等等。<br><br><br>
我到底做错了什么?一定是我哪里不对劲。<br><br><br>
去健身房时也是同样的情形。我是个初学者，可能动作不标准。我觉得自己做错了练习，担心别人觉得我看起来很愚蠢。我一直觉得大家都在评判我。<br><br><br><br>
在咖啡馆时，我觉得自己做错了什么，比如去错了卫生间。我害怕有人会根据我的外表或行为来评判我。<br><br><br>
<b>这或许就是所谓的聚光灯效应。</b><br><br>
当我想通过去健身房或每天写作来提升自己时，有时也会害怕家人或朋友因此评判我。他们可能会根据我的锻炼方式或者我为什么每天写作来评判我。所有这些想法最终都演变成对自己行为的过度思考。<br><br><br><br>
我一直以为大家都在乎我做了什么。<br><br><br>
每当我做了什么并发到社交媒体上时，我觉得大家都会关心。有时我去便利店买东西，我以为如果碰到朋友，他们会在意我买了什么。我出去度假发帖时，我以为大家会在意我去了哪里，做了什么。<br><br><br><br>
后来我意识到：没人真正关心。<br><br>
他们甚至不想关心。每个人都有自己的问题。他们有自己的生活，有每天每分钟要完成的目标。最终，他们并不真正关心我们在做什么或者我们怎么想。他们或许会在意五分钟。<br><br><br>
之后，他们回到自己的生活，关注自己家庭的问题。他们可能感到难过或愤怒。如果他们有这些问题，哪里还有时间去想我们?当我们犯错时，真的会有人在意超过一个小时吗?<br><br><br><br>
其实并没有。<br><br>
就像我看到有人骑摩托车摔倒时一样。那并不是什么大事故，他只是从自己的车上摔了下来。也有一些人在帮他。附注:他没事。然后呢?我会思考他摔倒的原因或者他怎么摔了一整天吗?不会。我很快就转向自己的问题，继续专注于健身锻炼，思考今天要写些什么。我专注于自己。只有我。没有其他人，没有其他想法，只有我自己。<br><br><br><br><br>
我们只是反应过度了。<br><br>
没人真正关心。<br><br>
我们以为大家都在看我们。<br><br>
我并不是说我们自恋，只是说这种感觉很正常，觉得别人可能在评判我们或者盯着我们。<br><br><br><br>
但如果我们因此采取行动，这就不对了。<br><br>
别人怎么看我们，不应该左右我们。<br><br>
别人如何评判我们，也不应该控制我们。<br><br>
别人如何看待我们，不该成为我们的束缚。<br><br>
除非你认为这些有助于你的成长。<br><br><br>
有时候别人给我一些建议，我不会接受，甚至会感到冒犯，但我知道自己确实做错了。这时候你需要放下自我，变得更好。即便如此，那些看着我们、评判我们的人也只是在没有考虑我们真正需要什么的情况下控制了我们。<br><br><br>
你能学到什么?<br><br>
你能学到的是，专注于自己。努力提升自己。勤奋锻炼。不断变好。早起。睡够。这些才是你该专注的。你不必思考别人怎么看你或如何对待你。只要专注于提升自己。每天至少进步1%。<br><br><br><br><br>
当我不再考虑别人，意识到他们并不在乎时，我变得更加专注。我变得更加自律。我有了自由，去做我想做的事。你也一样。如果你不小心停错了车位，你有自由;如果你点错了菜单，你有自由;如果你说错了话，你也有自由。至少你从这些错误中学到了东西。<br><br><br><br>
你变得更好。你反思自己。<br><br>
这些远比别人怎么看你或怎么评判你重要得多。<br><br><br>
专注于自己。<br><br>
提升自己。<br><br>
保持专注。
